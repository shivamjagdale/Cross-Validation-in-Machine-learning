Cross Validation in Machine learning
Here we will see how to build and test all the models are one time

First we will do that by train_test_split and then by cross_val_score
Train test split only calculates the accuracy score for only a specific test data.
Cross val score (Cross Validation) takes into consideration all the data points and hence it is more reliable
